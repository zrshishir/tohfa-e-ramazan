        "footnotes": "[2]- All\u0101h is a proper name belonging only to the one Almighty God, Creator and Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them, the Eternal and Absolute, to whom alone all worship is due.\n[3]- Ar-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n and ar-Ra\u1e25eem are two names of All\u0101h derived from the word \"ra\u1e25mah\" (mercy) . In Arabic grammar both are intensive forms of \"merciful\" (i.e., extremely merciful) . A complimentary and comprehensive meaning is intended by using both together. Ra\u1e25m\u0101n is used only to describe All\u0101h, while ra\u1e25eem might be used to describe a person as well. The Prophet (\ufdfa) was described in the Qur\u2019\u0101n as ra\u1e25eem. Ra\u1e25m\u0101n is above the human level (i.e., intensely merciful) . Since one usually understands intensity to be something of short duration, All\u0101h describes Himself also as ra\u1e25eem (i.e., continually merciful) . Ra\u1e25m\u0101n also carries a wider meaning - merciful to all creation. Justice is a part of this mercy. Ra\u1e25eem includes the concept of speciality - especially and specifically merciful to the believers. Forgiveness is a part of this mercy. In addition, Ra\u1e25m\u0101n is adjectival, referring to an attribute of All\u0101h and is part of His essence. Ra\u1e25eem is verbal, indicating what He does: i.e., bestowing and implementing mercy."
